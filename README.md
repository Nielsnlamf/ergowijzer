This is a semester long project for our course as Software Developers.
We have been tasked with creating an educational website, informing visitors about the dangers of RSI as well as how to prevent it.

This website will not be used for anything other than our education. It will be put online so our teachers can grade it.

Our "client" has asked us to make a smooth sliding system, both vertical and horizontal to create a type of animation about RSI.
For this we have elected to use FullPage.js
